# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

The icons should represent the YouTube Video Summarizer + Read Aloud functionality. A good design would be:
- A stylized "YT" logo combined with a speech bubble or text summary icon
- Color scheme: YouTube red (#FF0000) with white or light gray text
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes

Please create these icon files using an image editor and place them in this directory before packaging the extension.
